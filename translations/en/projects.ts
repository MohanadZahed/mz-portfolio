    haba: 'My role involved enhancing the performance of our client\'s shops while simultaneously reducing maintenance costs. The shops were experiencing long loading times, mainly due to an excess of unused JavaScript code and the lack of caching strategies.

To facilitate this transition, I extracted the necessary code from the SAP composable storefront, organizing it into a dedicated library. This not only preserved functionality but also resulted in a further 10% reduction in the size of both shops.',
